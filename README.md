# Blockchain-Voting-System
Creates a prototype blockchain to store voting data. Facial recognition is used to identify a users voting ID. After validation of the voter is complete a prompt is presented for
the user to input their vote. After a vote is submitted it is sent to pending_votes, where it sits until being added to the blockchain after the polling booth closes.
