# Blockchain-Voting-System
Creates a prototype blockchain to store voting data. Facial recognition is used to identify a users name. After validation of the voter name being in the voter register,
the user is prompted for their voter ID. Then the system checks to make sure the detected name correlates to the inputted ID. After a vote is submitted it is sent to pending_votes, where it sits qued until being added to a new block after the polling booth closes.
